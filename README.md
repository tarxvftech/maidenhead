Maidenhead
==========

A simple C library for converting between
latitude and longitude in degrees to [Maidenhead grid
squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidenhead_Locator_System),
commonly used in ham radio.

This is the only implementation I'm aware of that supports arbitrary
precision in encoding or decoding, and the only one in C that doesn't
seem completely brain-dead to me. YMMV, hope it's useful.
